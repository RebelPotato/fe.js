# fe.js:  Simple extensible effects in javascript

A simple & not too slow implementation of extensible effects.

This is a simple-minded implementation of extensible effects ([freer monads](https://okmij.org/ftp/Haskell/extensible/index.html)), as described in [Freer monads, more extensible effects](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2804302.2804319).
